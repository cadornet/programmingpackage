This RMarkdown document illustrates the core functions developed within the programmingpackage. Each function corresponds to a specific analysis step in the single-cell RNA-seq pipeline. The script includes usage examples and explanations, demonstrating how each function contributes to data filtering, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and annotation.
In this fold there is also a Vignette which  walks through the complete single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline using the custom R package programmingpackage. It describes each step — from data loading and preprocessing to PCA, UMAP, clustering, and cell type annotation — using modular, well-documented functions. The vignette is designed for reproducibility and clarity, helping users understand how to apply the package to their own datasets.
