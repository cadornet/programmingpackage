## Tissue Origin Inference

Top predicted cell types:
 - T_cells: 4935
 - Monocyte: 3805
 - B_cell: 852
 - NK_cell: 473
 - Pre-B_cell_CD34-: 51

Inferred tissue of origin:
Lymphoid tissue
This hypothesis is supported by the high abundance of immune-related cell types typically resident or maturing in lymphoid tissues. The dominance of T cells and B cells, together with the presence of NK cells and Pre-B cells, strongly suggests that the sample may derive from lymphoid tissue, such as lymph nodes, spleen, or thymus. The observed UMAP structure—showing well-separated immune cell populations—is consistent with this interpretation.
