### Tissue Origin Inference

Top predicted cell types:
 - T_cells: 4935
 - Monocyte: 3805
 - B_cell: 852
 - NK_cell: 473
 - Pre-B_cell_CD34-: 51

Inferred tissue of origin:
**Unknown**

This hypothesis is based on the frequency of annotated cell types and the cluster structure observed in the UMAP.
